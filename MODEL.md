# Model Used in This Project

## Model Name
Large Language Model (LLM) – ChatGPT

## Model Type
Generative AI (Text Generation)

## Architecture
Transformer-based Neural Network

## Description
The model used in this project is a pre-trained Large Language Model capable of
understanding and generating human-like text. It has been trained on large-scale
text data and can perform tasks such as explanation, summarization, question
answering, and content generation.

## Role of the Model in This Project
- Generates responses based on user prompts
- Demonstrates how different prompt designs affect output
- Used to test Zero-shot, One-shot, Few-shot, and Role-based prompting

## Training Method
- Pre-trained on large datasets
- Fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

## Limitations
- Can generate incorrect information
- Depends on prompt quality
- May reflect bias from training data

## Ethical Considerations
- Used only for educational purposes
- Human supervision required
